# Weather Journal App

## Description

This project is about working with Web APIs and how the connection between server-side and client-side works, I've used OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather condition based on given Zipcode for the city (US only), and our own server-side api to store the response from OpenWeatherMap API then display the results to the user, all of that happened by using JavaScript and asynchronous function.
